# API_Project
A Repository where I get started with the API stuffs, POST, GET requests and responses.

In `weather_api.py`

I wanted to make a function to get the location as argument then use a [GeoCoding API](https://positionstack.com/) to get the `lat` and `lon` from it.

Then i'm gonna use some free `Weather API` to fetch the weather.
